## Tutorial for R Markdown and R Notebook

This presentation gives a brief introduction to [`R` Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [`R` Notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) and this tutorial is adapted from introductory materials on their websites.

### Overview

**`R` Markdown** is a text file type that has the extension `.Rmd`. 

It provides a reproducible document framework for data science, and you can use a single `R` Markdown file to both

- save and execute codes
- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

When you open the `R` Markdown file in the `R`Studio IDE, it becomes an `R` Notebook interface.  

**`R` Notebook** is an `R` Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively. Any `R` Markdown document can be used as a notebook, and all `R` Notebooks can be rendered to other `R` Markdown document types. A notebook can therefore be thought of as a special execution mode for `R` Markdown documents.

### Creating an `R` Notebook
You can create a new notebook in `R`Studio with the menu command *File -> New File -> `R` Notebook*, or by using the html_notebook output type in your document's YAML header.

After that, you will have an `R` Notebook with one code chunk.

### Markdown Basics
Format the text in your `R` Markdown file with Pandoc's Markdown, a set of markup annotations for plain text files. When you render your file, Pandoc transforms the marked up text into formatted text in your final file format:

### Inserting Chunks
In each chunk, the codes can be executed independently, and the output will appear beneath the chunk. 

New chunks can be inserted quickly using the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Alt + I** (OS X: **Cmd + Option + I**), or via the **Add Chunk** command in the editor toolbar.

### Chunk Options
Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the `{}` of a chunk header. Above, we use five arguments:

- `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. `R` Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
- `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
- `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
- `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results.

Also, you can process many languages in code chunks besides `R`. Some of the available language engines include:

- Python
- SQL
- Bash
- Stan
- JavaScript

To process a code chunk using an alternate language engine, replace the `r` at the start of your chunk declaration with the name of the language:

### Saving Your `R` Notebook
When you finish your `R` Notebook, you can choose to save the `.Rmd` file. At the same time, an `.nb.html` file is created alongside it. This file is a self-contained HTML file which contains both a rendered copy of the notebook with all current chunk outputs (suitable for display on a website) and a copy of the notebook `.Rmd` itself.

Also, the `R`Studio IDE knit button allows you to render your `R` Notebook to other formats like `.pdf` and `.docx`. You can render to additional formats by clicking the dropdown menu beside the knit button:

Here is how it works:
