### GitHub Tutorial

*Git* is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

#### Installation:
* Sign up for Github: [https://github.com]
* Install GitHub Desktop: [https://desktop.github.com/]

#### Initialization:
A *repository* is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder and can have multiple collaborators.
* Create a new empty repository
	* create through GitHub website
	* create through GitHub desktop
* Create a repository from existing local folder
	* create through GitHub website
	* create through GitHub desktop
* Fork and Clone an existing git repository
	* create through GitHub website
	* create through GitHub desktop
	
Some terminology:
Adapted from [https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

* Clone: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
* Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, the save also creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
* Fork: A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.
* Markdown: Markdown is a simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website.
* Pull: Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
* Push: Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.

    * Add/Change files
    * Commit to local repository
	* Push to remote repository
	* Pull to local repository
* Work with collaboration
	* Fork and clone a (master) repository
	* Create a branch
		* Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time. It creates a snapshot of the original branch.
    * Make a commit
